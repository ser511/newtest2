## This finally shows on GitHub this is my first example man I am so excited

So since this are first one a couple of things to remember
1. start out on git hub and create repository
2. Next go to your text editor mines VScode, Open a folder dedicated to your specific github repository/project I call it
3. After the folder is created and your open in it then open the terminal
4. Next type git clone and copy and paste the ssh key for the repository
5. Next after its been uploaded you should see the folder you created in git hub
6. After use git cd "NAMEHEREOFTHEFILE" to change the directory only type it, no "" or brackets
7. Type ls -la 
8. IF typeing in any file then make sure to SAVE regularly, then use git status

When your starting up again here the process to make changes again the order is SAVE on computer then git status , git add . , git status , git commmit -m "add message here", then git push (still need to finish this!!!)
